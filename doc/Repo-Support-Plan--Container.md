# Repo-Support-Plan

This plan describes stepwise features to transform the interactive environment to support persistent, preconfigured, collaborative development sessions.

## Phase 1: Persistent Workspace
- Set up container or VM that remains active during chat session.
- Mount repository as persistent volume.
- Provide command to suspend/resume environment.
- Deliver minimal environment for baseline editing and script execution.

## Phase 2: Preconfigured Tooling
- Pre-install common languages (Python, Node, etc.) and tools (compilers, linters, test runners).
- Provide chat command wrappers (`!test`, `!lint`, `!build`).
- Document default environment and configuration.

## Phase 3: Integrated Git Operations
- Implement chat commands for `git pull`, `git status`, `git commit`, and `git push`.
- Show diff previews and commit message suggestions.
- Link to GitHub Issues and PRs.

## Phase 4: Incremental Environment Setup
- Cache dependency installations per repo.
- Provide snapshot/rollback features to revert to prior state.

## Phase 5: Real-time Testing & Feedback
- Execute tests asynchronously and stream logs back to chat.
- Highlight failing lines and stack traces in context.

## Phase 6: Collaborative Features
- Allow multiple users to attach to same environment.
- Provide session log to track contributions.
- Implement follow mode for real-time command/output sharing.

## Phase 7: Customizable Templates
- Provide repo-specific environment templates.
- Support starter scripts accessible via short chat commands (`!run-tests`, `!start-devserver`).

## Phase 8: Security & Resource Controls
- Sandbox each session with limited network and compute quotas.
- Expose resource monitoring commands for CPU/memory.
- Implement auto-timeouts for idle sessions.

## Maintenance
- Keep base images updated with patches.
- Log usage and performance metrics to refine features.
